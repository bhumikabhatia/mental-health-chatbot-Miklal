<h3>A Mental health Chatbot</h3>

The goal of this project is to be able to build a fully functional question and answering chatbot. 
We use NLP to build a mental health chatbot based off advice and responses by verified psychologists all across the world.
It uses BERT pre-trained word embeddings and cosine similarity to perform similarity extraction and retrieves the response.
